Questions to answer
===================

As part of this lab, you will need to answer the questions in this file. Your answers will be graded. 

You can answer in English or French.

1 - Understand the simulation model
-----------------------------------

The method `Channel.send_packet` has the following structure:

```python
 1.  def send_packet(self, duration):
 2.     """Attempt sending a packet of a given duration.
 3.     
 4.     If there are any other active transmissions, a collision occurs.
 5.     """
 6.     # IMPORTANT: if a new transmission starts exactly when another one ends, let the old one finish processing first
 7.     yield self._env.timeout(0) # Let the other transmissions finish processing
 8.
 9.     new_transmission = Transmission(start_time=self._env.now, end_time=self._env.now+duration, collision=False)
10.     self._active_transmissions.append(new_transmission)
11.
12.     if len(self._active_transmissions) == 1:
13.         # There is no other active transmission, i.e., the channel is idle.
14.         # Record the time since the last transmission as idle time
15.         self.time_channel_idle += self._env.now - self.last_transmission_end_time
16.     else:
16.         # There are other active transmissions. Mark all transmissions as collisions.
17.         for transmission in self._active_transmissions:
18.             transmission.collision = True
19.
20.     # Wait until the transmission is complete and remove it from the active list
21.     yield self._env.timeout(duration)
22.     self._active_transmissions.remove(new_transmission)
```

#### Why does the Channel implementation not use a SimPy resource? (1 point)

2 - Implement the packet generation

3 - Analyze the Aloha protocol
------------------------------

#### What is the maximum throughput of the Aloha protocol? (1 point)

*Your answer here*

#### For which channel utilization does the throughput reach its maximum? (1 point)

*Your answer here*

*Your answer here*

#### Insert the plot of the channel occupation generated by the `optimize_aloha.py` script. (1 point)

*Your answer here*

#### The channel is empty (idle) for a large part of the time. What happens if we try to reduce the idle time by sending more packets? (1 point)

*Your answer here*
