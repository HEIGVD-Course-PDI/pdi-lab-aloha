Questions to answer
===================

As part of this lab, you will need to answer the questions in this file. Your answers will be graded. 

You can answer in English or French.

1 - Understand the simulation model
-----------------------------------

The method `Channel.send_packet` has the following structure:

```python
1.  def send_packet(self):
2.     """Attempt sending a packet of a given duration.
3.     
4.     If there are any other active transmissions, a collision occurs.
5.     """
6.     # IMPORTANT: if a new transmission starts exactly when another one ends, let the old one finish processing first
7.     yield self.env.timeout(0) # Let the other transmissions finish processing
8.
9.     duration = self.packet_duration
10.    new_transmission = Transmission(start_time=self.env.now, end_time=self.env.now+duration, collision=False)
11.    self.active_transmissions.append(new_transmission)
12.
13.    if len(self.active_transmissions) == 1:
14.        # There is no other active transmission, i.e., the channel is idle.
15.        # Record the time since the last transmission as idle time
16.        self.time_channel_idle += self.env.now - self.last_transmission_end_time
17.    else:
18.        # There are other active transmissions. Mark all transmissions as collisions.
19.        for transmission in self.active_transmissions:
20.            transmission.collision = True
21.
22.     # Wait until the transmission is complete and remove it from the active list
23.     yield self.env.timeout(duration)
24.     self.active_transmissions.remove(new_transmission)n
```

#### Why does the Channel implementation not use a SimPy resource? (1 point)

2 - Implement the packet generation

#### Show the results of calling the `numpy.random.exponential` function several time, e.g., in the interpreter. (1 point)

3 - Analyze the Aloha protocol
------------------------------

#### What is the maximum throughput of the Aloha protocol? (1 point)

*Your answer here*

#### For which channel utilization does the throughput reach its maximum? (1 point)

*Your answer here*

#### Insert the throughput plot generated by the `optimize_aloha.py` script. (1 point)

*Your answer here*

#### Insert the plot of the channel occupation generated by the `optimize_aloha.py` script. (1 point)

*Your answer here*

#### The channel is empty (idle) for a large part of the time. What happens if we try to reduce the idle time by sending more packets? (1 point)
